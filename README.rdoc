Counting Bloom Filter implemented in Ruby.

Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to
test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but
false negatives are not. For more detail: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter

Performance of the Bloom filter depends on a number of variables:
- size of the bit array
- size of the counter bucket
- number of hash functions

To figure out the values for these parameters, refer to:

To learn about applications and reasons for the time based bloom filters, refer to:

== Implementation

Instead of using k different hash functions, this implementation seeds the CRC32 hash
with k different initial values (0, 1, ..., k-1). This may or may not give you a good
distribution, it all depends on the data.

== Example

  require 'bloomfilter'

  bf = BloomFilter.new(:size => 100, :hashes => 2, :seed => 1, :bucket => 3, :raise => false)
  bf.insert("test")
  bf.include?("test")
  => true
  bf.include?("test2")
  => false
  bf.delete("test")
  bf.include?("test")
  => false

  # Hash with a bloom filter!
  bf["test2"] = "bar"
  bf["test2"]
  => "bar"
  bf["test3"]
  => nil

  bf.stats
  Number of filter bits (m): 10
  Number of filter elements (n): 2
  Number of filter hashes (k) : 2
  Predicted false positive rate = 10.87%

== Example 1 - DNA Decrypting/Decoding/Deciphering

  <script language="JavaScript" src="ani.js"></script>
  <script language="JavaScript">
    dna_decrypt_title()
  </script>

== Example 2 - Binary Decrypting/Decoding/Deciphering

  <script language="JavaScript" src="ani.js"></script>
  <script language="JavaScript">
    binary_decrypt_title()
  </script>

== Example 3 - Custom Decrypting/Decoding/Deciphering

  <script language="JavaScript" src="ani.js"></script>
  <script language="JavaScript">
    decrypt_title("XO", 5, 100)
  </script>
